    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The chicken for these chicken fajita tacos marinates overnight, so youâ€™ll
      need to plan ahead, but when it comes to preparing dinner, your tacos will
      be ready in under 30 minutes.
    </p>

      <li>6 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

      <li>3/4 cup sour cream, at room temperature</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Strawberry Topping</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 quarts fresh strawberries, stems removed and halved, divided</li>
      <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
      <li>1/2 cup cold water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Break graham crackers
        into the bowl of a food processor. Add sugar and pulse until large
        crumbs form. Add butter and pulse just until combined and mixture
        resembles slightly wet sand.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly grease a 10-inch springform pan; press mixture lightly into the
        bottom and about 1 inch up the sides of the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until fragrant and slightly golden brown
        around the edges, about 8 minutes. Let cool. Reduce oven temperature to
        325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bring about 3 quarts of water to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer. Using a paddle
        attachment, whip cheese on medium speed just until smooth, to avoid
        incorporating too much air. Add sugar and beat until smooth, scraping
        down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add in sour cream, vanilla, lemon
        juice and salt and blend until just combined. With the mixer on low
        speed, add eggs, one at a time, mixing until each egg is fully
        incorporated, then mix until just combined and smooth, scraping down the
        sides of the bowl as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour mixture into the prepared crust. Wrap bottom and sides of pan well
        with heavy duty aluminum foil. Place the pan inside a large deep
        roasting pan and set pan in the oven. Carefully pour boiling water into
        the roasting pan around the cheesecake without letting any water inside
        the foil wrap or the cheesecake.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the center is very slightly jiggly,
        about 50 minutes. Carefully remove pans from the oven and allow
        cheesecake to cool in the water bath for 15 to 20 minutes. After about
        10 minutes, just when cheesecake starts to release itself from the
        sides, run a knife around the sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove wrapped cheesecake from water bath and place on a wire rack to
        cool completely, about 1 hour. Unwrap cheesecake and place in
        refrigerator until fully chilled and ready to serve, at least 4 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 1/2 of strawberries in a large saucepan and stir in sugar, lemon,
        vanilla, cornstarch, and water. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring
        often. Reduce heat to medium high and allow mixture to simmer until
        berries are softened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a potato masher, mash strawberries until slightly chunky; continue
        to simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in
        remaining strawberries, and let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate
        until ready to serve.
      </li>
      <li>Serve cheesecake slices with strawberry topping.</li>
